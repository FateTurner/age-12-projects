Hit or Miss is my first official python code and game for a while now. I mean, I used to do Python before, but I stopped after.
You don't know how to play? No worries, I've explained so in the game. Also, if you know how to play cows and bulls, it's the same thing, but singleplayer.
Also, credits to my dad for helping me with two functions. 
And yeah, I did this mainly for learning and practicing python and my programming logic, so I didn't put too much effort into the tutorial
and fixing bugs. Sorry 'bout that. 

My age when I made this: 12
