BurpBot is my first official discord bot. Unfortunately, when I started this project, I didn't make it compatible with many discord servers. Currently, it'll only work on my discord server - T3CH. If you want to know anything about me or any of my projects, feel free to contact me.

Also, some notes.

As I mentioned, this bot does not work in other servers, unless you edit the source code and make the guild id(burpserver), the id of your discord server, and maybe a few other things as I haven't tried this in any other server. If you want to run this, you'll need the discord.py package which can be downloaded from here > https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/ and of course a discord account and server to test it on. It's all completely free, so, no issues. 👍😊👍

My age when I made this: 12
